# computer_organization_notebooks
My personal lecture notes for the [Open University Computer Organization course](https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/20471.htm).

The course is based on the textbook *Computer Organization And Design - MIPS Edition* Sixth edition by *Patterson and Hennessy*.

Each lecture note corresponds to a chapter in the course (not the book).
